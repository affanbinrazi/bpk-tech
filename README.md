Step 1: Define Entity Classes

Create a package (e.g., com.ex.model) to store your entity classes.
Implement the Student and Mark classes with the appropriate attributes and mapping annotations.
Set up the relationships between the entities (e.g., one-to-many relationship between Student and Mark).

Step 2: Implement DAO Classes

Create a package (e.g., com.ex.dao) to store your DAO classes.
Implement a StudentDAO class with methods for retrieving students, marks, and generating the report.
Write HQL (Hibernate Query Language) queries to fetch the required data.
Calculate the percentage based on the marks obtained by each student.
Filter and return the list of students with scores above 60%.
Implement the necessary database operations and error handling logic in the DAO class.

Step 3: Create JSP Pages

Implement add_student.jsp to allow users to add new student details.
Create an HTML form to capture the necessary student information.
Submit the form to a servlet for processing.
Implement studentList.jsp to display the list of students and their details.
Use JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) to iterate over the list of students retrieved from the DAO class.
Generate an HTML table to display the student data.

Step 4: Implement Servlets

Implement AddStudentServlet to handle the form submission from addStudent.jsp.
Retrieve the form parameters from the request.
Use the StudentDAO class to add the student details to the database.
Redirect the user to studentList.jsp to display the updated list of students.
Implement StudentReportServlet to generate the report of students with scores above 60%.
Use the StudentDAO class to fetch the required data.
Pass the filtered student list to a new JSP page (e.g., student_report.jsp) for displaying the report.

Step 5: Create JSP for the Report

Implement student_report.jsp to display the report of students with scores above 60%.
Use JSTL to iterate over the filtered student list.
Generate an HTML table or any other desired format to display the report.
